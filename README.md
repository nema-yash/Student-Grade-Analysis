**Summary**

In Section 1, we tried to understand demographic and psychological behavior of students enrolled in Mathematics class in Portuguese schools. We saw that mathematics classes majorly consisted of students of ages between 15-18 and higher percentage of females were enrolled in the course. We also saw that having mother as primary guardian impacts the alcohol consumption and final G3 grades. The job and education of the student’s mother played a crucial role in predicting the final G3 performance. Also, we found that larger
number of students live in urban areas and have a lower travel time to schools due to this.

Then, in section 2, we tried to see what factors lead to alcohol consumption by students. Here we explored that most students have low alcohol consumption on workdays and weekend and are likely to drink more on 11 weekends compared to weekdays. We didn’t see a very significant impact of Pstatus (Parents separated or Together) on their alcohol consumption habits. We then found that being in a relationship resulted in more alcohol consumption on a workday.

Finally in section 3, we wanted to see if the alcohol consumption impacted final exam performance, and how we can use few variables from the entire dataset of 33 columns to predict the likely grade of a student. Here, we saw that G1 and G2 performance was crucial for good G3 final exam performance. Past failures, large travel times, Mother’s job play an important role in predicting the final G3 performance. Using just these 5-6 variables we can predict the final G3 grade without using all the 33 variables in the complete dataset.
